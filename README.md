# Daily Planner

## Description

The following assignment was to create a daily planner for someone with a busy schedule that can add things to time slots throughout the day and save and retrieve their schedule. This assignment included a mix of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, bootstrap and moment.js. The HTML and CSS were given, however I had to create the time blocks using bootstrap, with rows and columns. Once the time blocks were created the next step was to utilize the given classes of "past" "present" and "future". I created a for loop to run through each time block and compared it to real time. Depending what time it is, the time block color will change accordinly. Then, I created a function so when the save button is clicked, the information in the time block is saved to local storage and does not disappear when the page is refreshed.
